## Install

```bash
npm install -g pake-cli
```

If the installation fails and you are prompted that you do not have permission, please see this [website](https://gist.github.com/Giancarlos/d087f8a9e6516716da98ad0c0f5a8f58) .

Also make sure that you're using a correct Node.js version `>=16 as 16.18.1`. If you're using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for Node.js version management you may run `nvm use` from the root folder of the project and the correct version will be picked up. Other Node.js version management tools, such as [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) and [tj/n](https://github.com/tj/n), should also have similar feature.
